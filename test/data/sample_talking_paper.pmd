- Function: Speaking notes that outline and narrate a single issue to inform others during planned/scheduled oral presentations
    -- Provides both the outline of a single issue and quick-reference content on key points, facts, data, positions, or frequently asked questions
    -- Can stand alone for basic understanding; better with knowledge topic and related issues

- Format: Baseline standards below are flexible to save space and/or conform to user's needs
    -- Normally a single page (FYI: avoid lengthy chronologies and excessive detail)
    -- Headings (e.g. PURPOSE, DISCUSSION) are optional; save space by eliminating headings, by using run-in headings (e.g. Format, Flow), or both as in this example
    -- Bullets are short phrases or statements; telegraphic wording saves space
    -- Format the title, margins, dashes, line spacing, and text wrapping as in the Point Paper
    -- Punctuation: Normal rules apply for complete sentences and paragraphs; bullets may have internal punctuation but do not require closing punctuation
    -- Identification line: Format the same as for the Point Paper and place only on the first page, one (1) inch from bottom, fluh left; *alternatively placed in the footer, one half (1/1) inch from the bottom, flush left*
    -- Page numbering (if longer than one page): Place the number for page 2 onwards at the top of page, one-half inch from the top and flush with the right margins
    -- Classified content: See DOD 5200.1-R/AFI 31-401 to prepare classified Papers

- Flow: Clear statement, logical support, and closure
    -- Make it memorable with a literary device and solid sense of closure
    -- Include additional information as for your information (FYI) note at the appropriate place in the text/attached background paper (FYI: This is an example FYI note.)

- Recommendations or conclusion: Give your talk a solid sense of the way ahead or closure
