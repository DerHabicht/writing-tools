                    In a list with fewer levels, one might dispense with the capital roman numerals and capital letters and
                    instead begin with arabic numerals. What is important is that readers see at a glance the level to which
                    each item belongs. Note that each division and subdivision should normally contain at least two items.
                remarks:
                    - This means "short" outlines should be supported
                    - Short papers start with arabic numerals instead of capital roman numerals

                    Anyone who clings to the historically untrue---and thoroughly immoral---doctrine that 'violence never
                    settles anything' I would advise to conjure up the ghosts of Napoleon Bonaparte and of the Duke of
                    Wellington and let them debate it. The ghost of Hitler could referee, and the jury might well be the
                    Dodo, the Great Auk, and the Passenger Pigeon. Violence, naked force, has settled more issues in
                    history than has any other factor, and the contrary opinion is wishful thinking at its worst. Breeds
                    that forget this basic truth have always paid for it with their lives and freedoms.

                    Morals---all correct moral laws---derive from the instinct to survive. Moral behavior is survival
                    behavior above the individual level.
