            quote: >-
                In a list with fewer levels, one might dispense with the capital roman numerals and capital letters and
                instead begin with arabic numerals. What is important is that readers see at a glance the level to which
                each item belongs. Note that each division and subdivision should normally contain at least two items.
            remarks:
                - This means "short" outlines should be supported
                - Short papers start with arabic numerals instead of capital roman numerals
